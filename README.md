# GCN_Cora
This program tackles the Cora dataset using graph convolutional neural (GCN)

## Introduction
Cora dataset contains more than a thousand papers belonging to seven categories. Meanwhile, they are cited by each other. This dataset contains the word vector information of the papers and their citation relationship, which is actually a graph consisting of many nodes. We aim to classifiy the categories of these papers based on the word vector information and citation information. In this program, we tackle this problem using graph coonvolutional neural network (GCN) proposed in the paper "Semi-supervised classification with Graph Convolutional Networks".
